# Emotion Recognition App

This Emotion Recognition App uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect and classify human emotions in real-time. The model identifies various facial expressions and maps them to different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.

## Features

- **Real-time Emotion Detection:** Uses OpenCV to capture video input from a webcam and process it in real-time.
- **Emotion Classification:** Built using a deep learning model trained on facial expression data, leveraging TensorFlow for training and inference.
- **GUI Integration:** Simple interface to view emotion predictions directly from live video input.

## Tech Stack

- **TensorFlow:** For training the neural network model that classifies emotions.
- **OpenCV:** For capturing and preprocessing the video feed.
- **Python:** The core programming language used for developing the app.
- **Keras:** A high-level API for building and training the neural network.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
